Project Description

Learn the Basics of Wine! 

This app will set you on the way to becoming the oneophile (definition: google it!) that you've always wanted to be. And....you'll get the info you need to be able to identify the basic elements and components (yes, corny coding joke.....Steve!) that make enjoying wine even more enjoyable! 

The components will walk you through the 7 major growing regions with a concise defintion and description of the varietals themselves as well as identifying the predominant grapes of the major growing regions.

Oh, and if this encourages you to drink more wine...well? Drink more wine!
